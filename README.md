# Hot Peppers

A fun side project exploring hot peppers!

I grew up with very little spice in my diet -- my mother is Irish, what can I say? -- and get regularly mocked for my lack of spice tolerance. I figured that I'd do some research into these nuggets of suffering and glory so that the next time I am prompted to eat a pepper, I can distract my mocking friends enough to escape the actual act of pepper consumption.

## Data

Data is from [PepperScale's Hot Pepper List](https://www.pepperscale.com/hot-pepper-list/).

I used Python, [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) to extract, sanitize, and convert the data into `data/peppers.json`, available for your enjoyment.
